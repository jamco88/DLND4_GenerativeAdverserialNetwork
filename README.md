# GAN

## Environment Setup

I ahve assumed you are using Anaconda.

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

Before running this you should change the first line of the yml file to your desired environment name. Default is "deep-learning"

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml

```
## Structure

Exercises folder contains course materials and code from Udacity, together with my solutions.

Project folder contains the end of module project.


## Usage

The notebook can be run by opening a shell, activating the anaconda environment, followed by:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

You can then run the .ipynb file.

The notebook is intended to be self explanatory.

As mentioned above, some code is provided by Udacity.
